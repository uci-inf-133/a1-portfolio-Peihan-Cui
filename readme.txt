--Readme document for *Peihan Cui*, *peihanc@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
1. 6 images with appropriate alt texts
2. Appropriate headings and paragraphs 
3. Links to external pages (Linkedin, Github)
4. Custom icons from FontAwesome

(b) CSS features
1. Paddings and margins
2. Link, text colors, background colors are modified 
3. Using BootStrap 
4. Added custom fonts 

(c) Advanced features
1. Navigation bar on the top that jumps to the section on the page 
2. Burger menu in mobile with the collapsed navigation bar 

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

Yes I did. I ignored the potential problems from the accessibility checker. Most of them were about the images I 
had included or about the BootStrap class names. Namely how my alt text is written or how the bootstrap classes are
too complicated, etc. I also have a few warning about the headings that my header is used for formating text which it isn't.
There's a lot of "might be"s and I think they're not accessibility concerns because often times the checker is wrong and sometimes
there isn't a way to get around it like the complex BootStrap classes/format. 

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

Around 5 or 6. 

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

I've looked at how exactly to use BootStrap, with the help of the website and Generative AI.
I asked the AI how to write a burger menu with BootStrap instead of using plain CSS. 
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/

I have also asked Generative AI how to write certain CSS classes like how do I make this button
have a drop shadow and transition. 

I also used FontAwesome so I looked up icons pretty often.

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I did not consult my classmates but I did read the Slack channels we have for some questions with A1. 
I did show my portfolio to some friends to get feedback on the general aesthetic of it. 

7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

No.
